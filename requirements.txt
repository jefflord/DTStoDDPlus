# requirements.txt for DTStoDDPlus
#
# This project intentionally uses ONLY the Python standard library.
# There are currently no pip-installable dependencies required to run the tool.
#
# External binary dependencies (install separately, not via pip):
#   - MediaInfo CLI  (e.g. C:\Program Files\MediaInfo_CLI\MediaInfo.exe)
#   - ffmpeg         (e.g. C:\Program Files\ffmpeg\bin\ffmpeg.exe)
#
# If you later add features needing third-party libraries, list them below with pinned versions, e.g.:
# rich==13.7.1
# lxml==4.9.4
# tqdm==4.66.5
#
# (Keep this file committed even when empty so users know dependencies are intentionally minimal.)
